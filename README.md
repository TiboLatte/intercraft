# Intercraft
It's a simple api that you can use to write code from your ide directly to computercraft

## Installation
Just clone the repo into a file on your machine or a server.


## Usage
Just run 
```bash
node index.js
```
The code.lua file is where you'll write the code. You just need to save it when you want to send it.

On the computer you'll need to download this file from [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/c0rnMntQ) just use the pastebin get command.

Then you launch the program with this syntax :
```lua
[nameOfYourPastebinFile] destinationFile urlAddressOfYourServer
```

You can let the args empty and the destination file will be on default to "code" and the urlAddress to "localhost:3000", if you want to specify an address please make sure to write the address with "http://" in front of it.
